Since I had such a positive experience [learning about computer programming as a youngster](/posts/the-beginning-of-my-tech-journey), I attempted to recreate a similar experience for my own kids many years later. I found a fantastic website called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about), created by MIT. It uses a visual interface of coding blocks that can be dragged and dropped into place and allows users to create digital stories, games, and animations. I bribed my kids with money to get them to try it out and they built a few projects but haven't yet done anything else with it. As I learned about Scratch in order to teach them, I became more interested and really enjoyed building a few projects of my own over the years. Here are some of my favorites:

My dad was historically not a fan of technology. He did not own a smart phone, computer, or any other high-tech devices. However, at some point, I noticed that he was starting to enjoy playing games on my mom's iPhone. When he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021, I wanted to do something special for him, so I bought him a tablet and built this custom game just for him. It combines two of his favorite hobbies: fishing and slot machines.

I love in-person escape rooms and any kind of escape or puzzle games so I thought I'd try to build my own. This was my first significant Scratch project and I think it came out pretty well.

This was my second escape room game and it was fun to build. I intentionally made this one easier since the first game was more difficult and I wanted to have some variety.

This is a simple shooter game, built with the idea of trying a different style.\

During the pandemic, I decided to revist Scratch and build this Yahtzee game...with a sense of humor.

**Super Mario Kaboom!**

[Project Code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/188616857/editor)\
This game is inspired by the original [Kaboom! game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaboom!_(video_game)) on the Atari 2600. I decided to recreate that game with a Super Mario theme and it was really fun to make.
