When I was young, I heard a story about [Jim Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Mojo_Risin), the famous singer of The Doors.  He discovered that rearranging the letters of his name spelled 'Mr. Mojo Risin'.  How brilliant!  A very cool name, maybe even an alter ego, created just by shuffling letters around.  I love anything that's clever, anything that makes you think, and this is certainly a great example.

Not every person's name contains the proper letters which can be rearranged into other meaningful words.  And, even for those whose names do contain such letters, they may never be fortunate enough to find the right combination.  So imagine my surprise and satisfaction one day when I realized that Rodney could be rearranged to spell O'Nerdy!  I like this name because it includes multiple connections to my life.  In addition to using the letters of my name, it references my love of technology and even hints at my Irish ancestry.

This might just be better than finding a pot of gold!
